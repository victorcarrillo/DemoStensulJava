Here you can find a way to execute maven commands : 

Running a bash file , you can call the maven command and saving some time without having
to write the entire line.

Each one of the maven commands calls different property files which basically contains data from 
the different environments

Simply running 
```sh ./DemoArganoDev.sh``` 
or 
```sh ./DemoArganoSbx.sh``` 
should do the trick



There are different libraries to create screenshots, but that can be discussed later.
